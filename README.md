# CropDoctor - AI-powered Crop Disease Prediction

CropDoctor is an AI-powered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model deployed as a user-friendly website, enabling farmers to upload photos of afflicted crop leaves for disease prediction.

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a CNN model designed to predict crop diseases by analyzing images of diseased crop leaves. The model utilizes the DenseNet121 Architecture through transfer learning. It has been trained on a dataset of 87,000 images of leaves from commonly found diseased crops across the Indian subcontinent.

## Getting Started

To replicate this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the PlantVillage dataset.
2. Run the "leaf training DenseNet121.ipynb" file and ensure to edit the path for train, valid, and test directories.
3. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using the "testing 255x255x3.ipynb" file.

By following these steps and customizing the model's hyperparameters, you can explore and fine-tune the CNN model for plant disease detection. This implementation can also be leveraged for enhanced credit risk assessment in the financial domain. 

## Contributions

Feel free to use, modify, and build upon this repository for further research and applications. Your contributions are welcome in advancing crop disease detection and supporting farmers through innovative AI solutions. Let's work together to make agriculture more sustainable and resilient.
